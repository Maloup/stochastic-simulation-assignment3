# Stochastic Simulation Assignment 3: Parameter Estimation of the Lotka-Volterra model
This repository contains the code, figures, and data for the third and final assignment of Stochastic Simulation. It is organized in the following files:
- `Chronological data removal.ipynb` contains the code for the chronological
  data removal experiment.
- `Extrema data point removal.ipynb ` contains the code for the extrema data removal experiment.
- `Local vs SA optimization.ipynb` contains the code for the local vs global optimization experiment.
- `Objective functions comparison.ipynb` contains the  code for the objective function comparison experiment.
- `Simulated Annealing Parameter Tuning.ipynb` contains the code used for parameter tuning.
- `helper.py` consits of helper code such as data loading functions and objective functions.
- `optimization_func.py` consists of our simulated annealing implementation.
- `workers.py` consits of the workers used for parallelization of experiments.
